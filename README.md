my collection of my ulity files

Ive been trying to orginize my github; when I pull code out of a ok project before its deleted or archived it will be here

part of my todo list: https://workflowy.com/s/re-org-all-github-pr/IcuFhTaJopH6Nm4e

should I kanban this?

temp and copy and pasted files to unsorted

init by putting it into some folder and writing something in a readme

tested should have code coverage and documenting unittest

documented should have a good coherent block of text header, maybe someone other then me proof read?

finish should contain the best code I can write
